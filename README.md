# Grokking Algorithms
## An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other Curious People
+ Author: Aditya Bhargava, 2023, 12th edition.

#### " Grokking Algorithms is a fully illustrated, friendly guide that teaches you how to apply common algorithms to the practical problems you face every day as a programmer. You'll start with sorting and searching and, as you build up your skills in thinking algorithmically, you'll tackle more complex concerns such as data compression and artificial intelligence. Each carefully presented example includes helpful diagrams and fully annotated code samples in Python. "

## Motivation
- Since this book is fully explained in Python, I decided to show how to solve each chapter using Java and practice all the algorithms using this amazing language.
- Every time I finish a chapter, I'll try to apply the Java algorithm.
- Chapters in portuguese are "Capitulo" and I'm reading the brazilian portuguese version of this book.
